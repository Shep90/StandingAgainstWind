# StandingAgainstWind
ART 210 Project 2

Conceptual Ideas:
I created this with the idea that I could create growing lines that would emulate the path of strong wind as someone was standing against it. Without actually sketching anything, I set out learn to make the lines slowly grow across the image. 

Notes on Process:
I then grabbed an image off of google of a man standing against strong wind, and removed him in photoshop with the content-aware fill tool. Once I figured out the process of growing lines, I tried to create a loop that would grow the line inside a loop that would generate new lines based on given variables. That is where I ran into an issue. Either the lines would not complete where I told them to, or the program would crash just about every time. I tried a for loop inside an if/else statement, 2 for loops, 2 if/else statements, and an if/else statement inside a for loop, but to no avail. So, I decided to do away with the lines growing by themselves, and just use the for loop to generate complete lines. Once I finished my program with those parameters, I decided to join my curves file and my lines file together, as well as the lines themselves, and add color. Once I was satisfied with what I had created I added back in the remove function and button to remove the png of the figure.
